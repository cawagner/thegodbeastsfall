            Most media is from <a href="http://www.opengameart.org">OpenGameArt.org</a>.
            Music is from the aptly-named <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/generic-8-bit-jrpg-soundtrack">Generic 8-bit JRPG Soundtrack</a> by <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/avgvst">avgvst</a>.
            Character sprites and portraits are by <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/charlesgabriel">Antifarea</a>, tiles are by <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/surt">surt</a> and <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/bart">bart</a>.
            The in-game dialogue font is <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/view.php?post=243">Deathwake</a> by the
            <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/">Pickford Brothers</a>. Enemy sprites are mostly mine, but if something looks oddly well drawn, it might be by Antifarea instead during this prototype phase.

            This game is obviously a WIP, but when it's either finished or abandoned, all of my original art will also be going back into the OGA. Thank you for a great resource! Likewise, the game's source will be MIT licensed - just not yet because some of the code still makes me cry.
